          <h1 className="my-4">Hi!</h1>
          <p className="my-4">My name is Stephen Yang, and welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
          <p>I'm interested in mechatronics and operating at the intersection of software engineering and physical systems. I graduated from UofT in computer engineering, and I'm currently working through my Masters of Applied Science under the supervision of Professor Eric Diller, where I focus on the simulation and development of millimeter scale medical microrobots. </p>
          <p className="my-4">Previously, I worked on FPGA IP Development at Intel and at the UofT Multimedia Lab on ML for computational pathology.</p>
          <p className="my-4">When I'm free, I enjoy brewing coffee (V60 and Moka), lifting rocks, 3D printing and reading. Feel free to reach out via email!</p>
